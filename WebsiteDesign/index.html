          Your channel is one of the best I've seen. I'm new to coding (only two
          months learning HTML and CSS) but your tutorials and cool template
          ideas motivate me every time. Thanks! If I may ask, how long did it
          take for you to feel like you've mastered template creation? Sometimes
          it's difficult for me to create things on my own
